This repo holds the first phase of a project for a university course distributed systems. The idea was to build a multimedia content system using java 8, in which the information we want to transmit is a video
from one or more users to a multitude of multiple subscribers. Due to
large number of users we want to serve, we need to
implement a smart system, which will be able to transfer and
to the appropriate consumers the relevant content. In order to share with
users the relevant information, we need to know who they are
interested in it (subscribers), how they can show interest in it
(topic subscription) and how they can get it. This information will
be properly transferred from the system we are called to implement so that the
users can watch the video as soon as it becomes available on the system.


This project concerns the implementation of the video streaming Framework (Event Delivery System) which is responsible for supporting the promotion and download (streaming) multimedia data.
